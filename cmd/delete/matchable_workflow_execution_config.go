Delete workflow execution config for the given project and domain combination or additionally with workflow name.

Delete workflow execution config label for project and domain.
For project flytectldemo and development domain, it is:
::

 flytectl delete workflow-execution-config -p flytectldemo -d development 


Delete workflow execution config using config file which was used to create it.
Here, the config file is written to wec.yaml.
Max_parallelism is optional in the file as it is unread during the delete command but can be kept since the same file can be used for get, update or delete commands.
e.g., content of wec.yaml which will use the project domain and workflow name to delete the resource.

::

 flytectl delete workflow-execution-config --attrFile wec.yaml


.. code-block:: yaml
	
    domain: development
    project: flytectldemo
    max_parallelism: 5

Delete workflow execution config for a workflow.
For the workflow 'core.control_flow.run_merge_sort.merge_sort', it is:

::

 flytectl delete workflow-execution-config -p flytectldemo -d development core.control_flow.run_merge_sort.merge_sort
