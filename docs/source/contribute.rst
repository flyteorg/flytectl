###########################

First off, thank you for thinking about contributing! 
Below you‚Äôll find instructions that will hopefully guide you through how to contribute to, fix, and improve FlyteCTL.

üìù Contribute to Documentation
==============================

Docs are generated using Sphinx and are available at [flytectl.rtfd.io](https://flytectl.rtfd.io).

To update the documentation, follow these steps:

1. Install the requirements by running ``pip install -r doc-requirements.txt`` in the root folder
2. Make modifications in the `docs/source/gen <https://github.com/flyteorg/flytectl/tree/master/docs/source/gen>`__ folder
3. Run ``make gendocs`` from within the `docs <https://github.com/flyteorg/flytectl/tree/master/docs>`__ folder
4. Open html files produced by Sphinx in your browser to verify if the changes look as expected (html files can be found in the ``docs/build/html`` folder)

üíª Contribute Code
==================

1. Set up a local cluster by running ``flytectl sandbox start --source=$(pwd)`` in the root directory
2. Run ``make compile`` in the root directory to compile the code
3. Run ``flytectl get project`` to see if things are working
4. Run the command you want to test in the terminal
5. If you want to update the command (add additional options, change existing options, etc.):
   * Navigate to `cmd <https://github.com/flyteorg/flytectl/tree/master/cmd>`__ directory
   * Each sub-directory points to a command, for example, ``create`` points to ``flytectl create ...``
